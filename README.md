# Giftastic!

## What the project does
This is an implementation of the Giftastic app, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. Based on user input, it pulls static and animated gifs from Giphy and displays them. Comments on the app and code will be added here when it is complete.

## How to get started with the game
You can play the game online at GitHub Pages eventually, but it's not yet ready.

## Authors
This game is being built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and will not be available.
