# Giftastic!

## What the project does
This is an implementation of the Giftastic app, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. Based on user input, it pulls static and animated gifs from Giphy showing activities ranging from studying to sleeping to sports and displays them. The user can create new buttons for any topic desired.

## How to get started with the game
The app is live on GitHub Pages. Note that buttons respond only to clicks and not the enter key.

## Authors
This game was built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and will not be available.
